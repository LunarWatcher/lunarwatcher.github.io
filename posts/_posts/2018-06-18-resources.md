This post contains resources and tools for stuff I'm interested in, or in general use. 

## Disclaimer

None of these are paid promotions. I also cannot guarantee that the software is safe<sup>1</sup> -- I also take no responsibility for anything that happens if you install any of the programs or plugins, or visit the URLs. Use common sense when installing stuff.

<sub>1: They are theoretically safe (otherwise I wouldn't use them), but as with other programs, [shit does happen](https://www.dinside.no/data/populaert-gratisprogram-hadde-virus/68713332) that wasn't intended</sub>

## General tools

* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) 

## Graphic design

### Tools

* [Krita](https://krita.org/) - open-source drawing software.
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - free vector art software.

## Programming

### Tools

* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) has a lot of useful tools, including IDE's, CI, issue trackers, etc.
* [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) - Useful for regex validation.
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) - really useful for websites, since it allows creating modular pages with templates. Also powers this website.
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) - Nice editor, flexible, and my personal web dev favorite.
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Both code and non-code editor. Beats Notepad++.
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - extensible editor, supports a ton of programming languages. Unfortunately doesn't have auto-import, but I like it for a couple languages.
* [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) - Currently my favorite editor.


### Programming utilities

#### General/meta
* [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) - Linux-like terminal on Windows.
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - split terminal windows. Incredibly useful with SSH or for consoles without support for tabs.

#### C++

* [Conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan) - package manager. 
* [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja) - My preferred CMake generator. 
* [SCons](https://github.com/SCons/scons) - Open-source python-based build system.

#### Webdev
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Makes CSS coding a lot easier, especially with variables and imports.

### Vim

#### Plugins

Note that these are some select plugins I believe deserve some extra attention. The full list of plugins I use is [available in my .vimrc](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).

* [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) - Like Vundle, but better and async.
* [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) - File trees to get the IDE feel.
* [Tmux navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) - simplifies tmux-vim interop.
* [Deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) - async, and extremely extendible.
    * [LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim) - works with Vim 8 too. Adds some inline linting as well as extending autocomplete. 
* [Goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) - focus enhancer 
* [Limelight.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/limelight.vim) - along with Goyo, it gives a really nice text writing experience.
* [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) - perfect for notes, as well as wiki-style personal notes/documentation.
* [Startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) - beautiful start page
* [tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) - Lists tags in files; similar to the file structure overview in some IDEs. Also lists keybinds in `.vim`/`.vimrc` files.

#### Themes

* [Papercolor](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) - paper-like theme with a nice color scheme.
