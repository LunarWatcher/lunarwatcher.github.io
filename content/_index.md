# About me

Hiya! I'm Olivia. I'm a full-stack developer, and occasionally pretend to know to draw. On my free time, aside programming various projects for fun, I play games, enjoy one of my other hobbies, or do stuff in various places around the internet.

I'm also [mildly fond of Vim](https://github.com/lunarwatcher/dotfiles), and regularly tinker with my config files.
