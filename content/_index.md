# About me

Hiya! I'm Olivia. Every once in a while, I write about whatever I find interesting on this here blog, occasionally just as a means to publicly document my own, private notes of problems I've run into. I'm a fullstack developer, so I have a full stack of problems to go along with it.

Aside that, there isn't a whole lot to this website. If you're looking for more of my stuff, there's plenty on GitHub (and [other various places]({{<ref path="contact.md" >}})).


## Contact 

I have some contact options [listed here]({{<ref path="contact.md" >}}).
