# About me

Hiya! I'm Olivia (AKA Zoe, LunarWatcher, and a few other nick- and usernames). I'm a full-stack developer and artist. 

Nowadays I mostly work with C++ (when I'm not drawing or [growing the factory](https://factorio.com)), but I also know and use a bunch of other languages.

I'm also [mildly fond of Vim](https://github.com/lunarwatcher/dotfiles).
