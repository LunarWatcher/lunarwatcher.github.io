# My use of GPG

Obligatory note that you do not have to use GPG when contacting me. It exists as an alternative for the cryptographically inclined, and not as an absolute requirement that must be followed. If you have no idea what a GPG key is, nor plans to figure it out, you do not have to read this page.

I do not extensively use GPG. The key exists primarily for E2E emails, as well as the occasional email signature.

Consequently, you won't see it in (for example) commits or in normal emails, or in most of my day-to-day use. However, it exists there to provide the option if it ever comes up (which it so far, in my many years of internet use, hasn't).

An up-to-date GPG key can be found on [my GitHub](//github.com/LunarWatcher.gpg). Some registries contain it as well. **NOTE:** My current signature is <code>{{<site-param gpg-signature>}}</code>. Some registries contain an old key linked to my email that I cannot get rid of, because I deleted the private key and didn't realise, until it was far too late, that I needed to revoke the keys in the registries before doing so. Make sure you're using the new key if you're automatically pulling from a registry, rather than grabbing it from GitHub. I have not synced the new key to all the registries I did last time I had a GPG key either, meaning certain registries can provide an out-of-date key.
