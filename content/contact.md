## Contact etiquette
### Support related to &lt;insert the name of one of my repos here&gt;

Please consider opening an issue or discussion rather than contacting me directly. This is exclusively for information sharing, as it may allow others with the same problem to find information about it more easily. [We're not served](https://xkcd.com/979/) with discussions ending in "DM me" when it's a type of problem others might have.

### Job offers

I'm not interested in unsolicited job offers. I'm perfectly fine with looking for jobs on my own.

### Everything else

If not otherwise listed here, there's no particular restrictions aside the obvious one: _don't be an asshole_.

I'm also completely fine with being contacted for purely social reasons. I don't bite (unless bitten first).
