# Contact etiquette

I have a lot of contact methods:

{{<mdpartial "socialmedia.html">}}

And I do have some standards:

## Job offers

I'm not interested in out of the blue job offers. If I'm looking for a job, I'll make that abundantly clear and reach out rather than sit around and wait for a recruiter.

## Stack Overflow

If you have a problem with something I did on Stack Overflow or elsewhere in the SE network, feel free to contact me. However, I'll [report attempts](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/380083/6296561) at being rude to SO, as well as to whatever company runs the site where the message was sent (if applicable).

I have no problem looking over my decisions again, and defending or reverting them if appropriate - what I don't appreciate is getting a misdirected rant in my DMs.

Also note that I'll generally ignore links to questions - If I want to answer stuff on SO, I'll look for it myself.

## Programming questions

This is partially a subset of the [SO category](#stack-overflow).

I generally don't answer random programming questions I get in DMs. I do answer the periodic question [on my Discord server](#somediscord), but that's mostly questions asked by people who are a part of the community.

## Support related to &lt;insert the name of one of my repos here&gt;

Please consider opening an issue rather than contacting me directly. This is exclusively for information sharing if it's a problem that others might have. [We're not well-served](https://xkcd.com/979/) with discussions ending in "DM me" when it's a type of problem others might have. (Security vulnerabilities are an exception for obvious reasons).

## Everything else

If not otherwise listed here, there's no particular restrictions aside the obvious one: _don't be an asshole_.

I'm also completely fine with being DMed for purely social reasons. I don't bite (unless bitten first).
