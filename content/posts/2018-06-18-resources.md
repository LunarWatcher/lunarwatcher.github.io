## Disclaimer

None of these are paid promotions. I also cannot guarantee that the software is safe<sup>1</sup> -- I also take no responsibility for anything that happens if you install any of the programs or plugins, or visit the URLs. Use common sense when installing stuff.

<sub>1: They are theoretically safe (otherwise I wouldn't use them), but as with other programs, [shit does happen](https://www.dinside.no/data/populaert-gratisprogram-hadde-virus/68713332) that wasn't intended</sub>
