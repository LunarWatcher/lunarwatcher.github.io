title: Yes, I use light mode
toc: true
---

Some times, I share screenshots, and if it's in a public enough place, someone feels the need to point out my use of light mode. This especially happens in Linux and programming oriented places, where dark mode for some reason dominates.

I'm writing this because I'm tired of repeatedly defending my use of light mode. It's a preference, but some people seem to be incapable of understanding that. If you're reading this because I linked it in the middle of the start of another dark/light mode flame war, that someone is you! Or, more specifically, that's what you come across as. You could be doing it for the meme of it, but this is still what you come across as.

Now, there's many reasons for using dark mode. I acknowledge that, and this isn't an attempt to "convert" people to light mode or whatever. This entire post exists because I'm tired of defending my own use of light mode without needing to repeatedly get into the same discussion with the exact same arguments (because yes, they're really that old. You might think you're "advocating dark mode", but in reality, you're mentioning the same arguments as everyone else, all of which are preferences). That being said, I am going to take a few stabs at dark mode in general. You can agree or disagree, and either way continue to use dark mode - I really don't care. It's still your preference.

Some commonly cited reasons for using dark mode:

* It reduces eye strain ([it really isn't, by the way](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/dark-mode-chrome-android-ios-science))
* It's easier to read
* It's better working in the dark with dark mode
* It looks better
* "I don't want a flashlight", [commonly accompanied with this thought of developers who use light mode](https://twitter.com/discord/status/974022175379222528) (tweet not embedded due to privacy issues from Twitter injecting bullshit I didn't ask for onto my website)<br>
    ... and this general attitude shows up far too often. 

Admittedly, I do use dark mode for a couple programs, and I know dark mode does have some uses. Having a dark/light mode that automatically switches based on the time of day in a car has practical uses, but that isn't a screen you should be staring at for several hours straight anyway. I also use dark mode in Krita, in part because I won't be staring at the interface itself. Using dark mode reduces the attention the interface, which I won't be looking to much at anyway, tries to get. Also, the canvas itself usually starts out on a light grey color, so it's mixed.

## The eye strain argument

Some people cite their use of dark mode as "reducing eye strain", and while that may work for you, it really doesn't for me. I use a blue light filter [set up aggressively](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/dotfiles/blob/master/config/redshift.conf#L3-L4) to mitigate that. Without it in some or another form, for me, eye strain is present on both dark and light mode. Blue light also [provably has negative effects on eyes](http://preventblindness.org/blue-light-and-your-eyes/), as well as sleep. Additional sources point to blue light exposure as a source of eye strain. There's also a lot of conflicting information in this field in general, but it logically makes sense. That, however, is a whole can of worms and research I really don't want to poke on a site that really just exists to defend my use of light mode.

## The readability argument

I actually find dark mode harder to read than light mode. I have nothing more to say about this, because there's no point in backing this up with research because it's (_shock_), a personal preference.

That being said, [light mode crushes dark mode in research](https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/53268/135591).

## The "it's better to work with in the dark" argument

Not for me. And yes, I do indeed some times sit in the dark, with light mode, relatively late at night and code. Often with a candle lit, just because why not? Dimming the brightness also makes it a lot more comfortable, and because it's in the dark, it doesn't sacrifice readability.

## The "it looks better" argument

This is extremely opinionated, but dark mode is harder to design for. Additionally, dark backgrounds and color contrast are a pain to work with. Contrast is also a bit of an issue for me. Also, I personally feel that dark mode makes it harder to use expressive colors. Also, if you like some good irony, [the person who implemented dark mode on Stack Overflow isn't a fan of it either](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/31/building-dark-mode-on-stack-overflow/) (ref. the second and third paragraph after the opt-in banner picture).


## The flashlight argument

Now, to take a stab at the flashlight "argument": it really isn't that bad (... in the context of computers. Again, as mentioned earlier, it does have use in cars, but that isn't a display you'll be staring at for hours). My screen brightness generally sits at around 50%, and I reduce it to about 25% if I sit in the dark. I don't need sunglasses to use it ~~unless I turn off the blue light filter~~.

If you're here because you complained about SoMEthInG bRIghT bLInDinG YoU, you really need to turn down your brightness, and get outside more during the day (or in the midnight sun, if that's applicable).

And yes, that last one does indeed directly bash certain dark mode users, but that's much more about their attitude than dark mode itself. Again, I don't mind dark mode, I just don't prefer using it, and I really don't appreciate it when people bash my theme selection just because it isn't dark. [We already have enough flame wars over stupid stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war) ([also relevant; fourth and fifth from the bottom](https://i.imgur.com/M5wl14r.png)).

And, if you still have a problem with me using light mode, or anyone else using light mode for that matter: **no one cares**. Themes are, at the end of the day, a preference. Both variants have their advantanges and disadvantages - neither of them have warnings that are so bad associated with them that it causes the abolishment of the themes. Move on and stop trying to ignite a flame war for no fucking reason.
