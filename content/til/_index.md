# Today I learned

Inspired by [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), this is a long list of small bits of information I discover while programming, or doing other stuff, ranging from bugs and time sinks to "I wish I had known this before".

## C++

* [C++ time sucks: incomplete time parsing]({{<ref path="/til/cpp/incomplete-time-parsing.md">}})

## CMake

* [Setting the MSVC runtime library in CMake, and why CMake doesn't respect your options]({{<ref path="/til/cmake/runtime-library-options-ignored.md">}})

## Conan

* [The modern way to limit Conan's CPU use]({{<ref path="/til/conan/cpu-core-limiting.md">}})

## Git

* [Correctly committing LF rather than CRLF]({{<ref path="/til/git/crlf.md">}})

## Linux

* [Disabling SSH password auth on Ubuntu Server]({{<ref path="/til/linux/disable-password-auth-ubuntu-server.md">}})

## Lua

* [Multiple returns from the `__index` meta method]({{<ref path="/til/lua/multiple-return-index.md">}})
