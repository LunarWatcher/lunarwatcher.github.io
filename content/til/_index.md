# Today I learned

Inspired by [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), this is a long list of small bits of information I discover while programming, or doing other stuff, ranging from bugs and time sinks to "I wish I had known this before".

## C++

* [C++ time sucks: incomplete time parsing](/til/cpp/incomplete-time-parsing.md)

## CMake

* [Setting the MSVC runtime library in CMake, and why CMake doesn't respect your options](/til/cmake/runtime-library-options-ignored.html)
