# Notes

I make some of my notes public, for no reason in particular.

Again, these are notes, and may be suboptimal, or just blatantly wrong. Take the contents of the notes with a grain of salt, and not as a how-to guide on how to do &lt;some topic&gt; perfectly. (**TL;DR:** use common sense when reading)
