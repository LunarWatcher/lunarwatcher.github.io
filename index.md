# About me

Hiya! I'm Olivia.

I'm a fullstack developer, and an artist. I mostly program in Java and Kotlin, though I've also used Python, Scala, Batch, JavaScript, and PHP. Java, Kotlin, and Python are my favorite languages (though I prefer Java and Kotlin over Python). I also draw when I got time, and I also do UI and web design. 

Neural networks and AI in general is one of my favorite topics in programming. I'm far from a machine learning expert, but I still find it interesting.

If you want to talk to me, you can find me in my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/{{site.discord-server | cgi_escape | escape}}), or you can send me an [email](mailto:{{site.email | cgi_escape | escape}}). The complete list is in [the footer](#social-media).
