# About me

Hiya! I'm Olivia. I'm a full-stack developer and artist. 

Nowadays I mostly work with C++ (when I'm not drawing), but I also know and use a bunch of other languages.

# Activity on Stack Overflow 

If you're looking to contact me about something I did on SO (or anywhere else in the network), please try to keep it on-site unless there's some special reason that prevents it - for an instance deletion. Otherwise, you can contact me in one of the ways listed later on this page. Note that I will not respond to rude messages (see also [this](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/262202)). If you're angry about something, take a breather before you start writing.
