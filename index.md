# About me

Hiya! I'm Olivia.

I'm a fullstack developer, and an artist. I mostly program in Java and Kotlin, though I've also used Python, Scala, Batch, JavaScript, and PHP. Java, Kotlin, and Python are my favorite languages (though I prefer Java and Kotlin over Python). And of course C++, but I'm still learning that. I also draw when I got time, and I also do UI and web design. 

Neural networks and AI in general is one of my favorite topics in programming. I'm far from a machine learning expert, but I still find it interesting.

Also a huge fan of Vim, and it's currently my main code editor. The flexibility is a huge plus, and how easy it is to install a plugin is so far unmatched by other editors I've tried. I also keep a live version [of my .vimrc on GitHub][1]. Some other dotfiles are in the same repo.

If you want to talk to me, you can find me in my [Discord server][2], or you can send me an [email][3]. The complete list is in [the footer](#social-media). In addition, you can find me in chat on all the Stack Exchange chat sites.
