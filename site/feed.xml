      <description>Introduction For those of you who haven&#39;t paid attention to the recent mess on Stack Exchange, there&#39;s quite a few things going on. The current issues started with SE firing a moderator over a change to the CoC (Code of Conduct) that enforced correct pronoun use. SE has stated it was a violation of the (at the time) current CoC, but they&#39;re still unwilling to tell the moderator in question what she did.</description>

      <description>The Raspbian package repos are, in my experience, extremely slow with updates. Ninja pre-dates version one, Python3 is still stuck on 3.5.2, and a lot of other packages are outdated. Installing from source isn&#39;t always easy, because they get new dependencies, and suddenly you have accidentally missing packages and compiling fails. So here&#39;s a list of some install guides for various tools.
Note This is currently targeting a version of Raspbian that doesn&#39;t support 64 bit.</description>
