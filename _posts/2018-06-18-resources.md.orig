This post contains resources and tools for stuff I'm interested in, or in general use. 

## Disclaimer

None of these are paid promotions. I also cannot guarantee that the software is safe<sup>1</sup> -- I also take no responsibility for anything that happens if you install any of the programs or plugins, or visit the URLs. Use common sense when installing stuff.


<sub>1: They are theoretically safe (otherwise I wouldn't use them), but as with other programs, [shit does happen](https://www.dinside.no/data/populaert-gratisprogram-hadde-virus/68713332) that wasn't intended</sub>

## General tools

* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) 

## Graphic design

### Resource sites

### Tools

* [Krita](https://krita.org/) - free drawing software.
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - free vector art software.

## Programming

### Resource sites

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - lots of answers to programming questions.
* [Open Source Stack Exchange](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/) - Lots of answers to questions about open-source
* [Software Recommendations Stack Exchange](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/) - as the name suggests; software recommendations.
* [Siraj Raval's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A) - machine learning stuff.

### Tools

* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) has a lot of useful tools, including IDE's, CI, issue trackers, etc.
* [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) - Useful for regex validation.
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) - really useful for websites, since it allows creating modular pages with templates. Also powers this website.
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) - Nice editor, flexible, and my personal web dev favorite.
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Both code and non-code editor. Beats Notepad++.
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - extensible editor, supports a ton of programming languages. Unfortunately doesn't have auto-import, but I like it for a couple languages.
* [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) - Slowly becoming one of my favorite editors for everything but Java, Kotlin and other import-heavy languages where there are a lot of imports.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - fantastic on Linux. On Windows, especially with Cygwin, it struggles finding stuff for auto-complete.

### Programming utilities

#### General/meta
* [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) - Linux-like terminal on Windows.
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - split terminal windows. Incredibly useful with SSH or for consoles without support for tabs.

#### C++

* [Conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan) - package manager. 
* [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja) - My preferred CMake generator. 


#### Webdev
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Makes CSS coding a lot easier, especially with variables and imports.

### Vim

#### Plugins

* [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) - Like Vundle, but better and async.
* [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) - File trees to get the IDE feel.
* [Auto pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs) - closes brackets, quotes, and similar.
* [Tmux navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) - simplifies tmux-vim interop.
* [Completor](https://github.com/maralla/completor.vim) - Async Vim 8 autocomplete (that actually works without much setup effort!)

#### Themes

* [Papercolor](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) - paper-like theme with a nice color scheme.
